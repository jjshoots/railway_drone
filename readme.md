# Railway Drone Repo
Training a drone to fly along a railway, avoiding obstacles, quantifying uncertainty in the flight path, and detecting defects along the way. Completely trained in simulation with domain randomization for zero shot transfer to the real world. Environment is procedurally generated. Navigation is trained using Evidentially Supervised Soft Actor Critic (e2SAC), paper publication soon.
