# Railway Drone Repo
Training a drone to fly along a railway, avoiding obstacles, quantifying uncertainty in the flight path, and detecting defects along the way. Completely trained in a zero shot domain randomization manner. Environment is procedurally generated. Navigation is trained using Uncertainty Aware Semi Supervised Reinforcement Learning (UA3SAC), paper publication soon.


This repo is a work in progress.
